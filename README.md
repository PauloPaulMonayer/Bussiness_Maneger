A software tool designed to streamline business management processes by automating daily tasks, tracking key metrics, and improving decision-making for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This project was developed as part of my computer science degree.

## Features

- **Inventory tracking:** Automatically track stock levels and generate low-stock alerts.
- **Sales reporting:** Generate real-time reports on sales performance and revenue.
- **Task automation:** Schedule recurring tasks and automate routine business operations.
- **User-friendly interface:** Built with ease of use in mind, allowing business owners to manage tasks without technical expertise.

## Built With
- **Java** - The core programming language used for backend logic.
- **JavaFX** - Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **SQLite** - A lightweight database for storing client and sales information.
- **Maven** - For project management and dependency management.
- **JUnit** - For unit testing and ensuring code quality.
